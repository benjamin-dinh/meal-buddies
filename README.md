# MealBuddies

## Inspiration
Food security and food access is a growing concern for many in Yolo County. Although there are many organizations that provide food, it is difficult to find what services are available. According to the U.S Census Bureau, one in six Yolo County residents is food insecure.

COVID-19 has made it even more difficult for people to receive support. Hitting low-income households the hardest, people are in need of accessible food resources more than ever.

## What it does
MealBuddies is a web-app that provides information about different types of food services that best meet individual needs.

Our online community connects people to local organizations/events that offer food and services to the communnity. Our web application allows local organizations and restaurants to provide food. We maintain and update the MealBuddies database with different food providers. Our purpose is to connect people to find a meal as conveniently as possible.

## How we built it
MealBuddies was built using HTML, CSS, NodeJS, Edamam Recipe API, Firebase Realtime Database and Firebase Storage. We utilized ExpressJS to establish connections between the client and server. MealBuddies fetches information from our FirebaseDatabase to create dynamically updated cards that our users can interact with. MealBuddies also offers resources such as recipe inspiration pulled from Edamam.
